# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The analysis is based on the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers' demographics, ticket details, and survival status.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more. It is a popular dataset for practicing classification problems in data science and machine learning.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Build machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts included in the project.
4. Explore the analysis and model results.
